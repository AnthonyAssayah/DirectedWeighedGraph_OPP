# Directed & Weighted Graphs - EX2_OOP

## Presentation ðŸ“Œ

This project is based on ***Design and Implementation*** of directed and weighted graphs for an OOP assigment. This exercise is composed of two main parts, the first is to
implement the five different interfaces in order to create all the elements that form a graph. The second part is the GUI, which will allow us to really visualize 
the graph and all its parameters and options. 

## Interfaces

There are 5 classes defined in this project, the interfaces are in the ```api``` package and their implementations can be found in ```classes``` package. Their properties and 
methods are detailed below.

### <ins>***1 - NodeData***<ins>


NodeDataObj is an implementation of a NodeData interface. This class is a simple representation of a vertex on a directed weighted graph and implement a set of different
operations.

Each ```NodeDataObj``` contains five attributes:

  - ```key```: This is the ID associated to each node.
  - ```location```: This is the position of the node in a 3D dimension with 3 coordinates(x,y,z).
  - ```weight```: This is a double variable used as node's weight initialized to 0. 
  - ```tag```: This is an Integer value used to calculate several algorithms initialized to 0.
  - ```info```: This is a string corresponding to nodeâ€™s meta data which helps us to calculate various functions initialized to "White".

  | **Functions**      |    **Explanation**        |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `NodeDataObj()` | A *copy constructor* to create a new NodeDataObj |
| `NodeDataObj (int key, GeoLocation g)` | A *constructor* taking two arguments |
| `getKey()` | Returns the "name" associated to a specific node |
| `getLocation()` | Returns the location (3D) of this node |
| `setLocation(Geolocation p)` | Changes the location of the node as *p*  |
| `getWeight()` | Returns the weight of this specific node |
| `setWeight(double w)` | Changes the weight of the node as *w* |
| `getInfo()` | Returns the meta data associated with this node |
| `setInfo(String s)` | Changes the meta data of the node as *s* |
| `getTag()` | Returns the tag value of the node |
| `setTag(int t)` | Changes the tag value for temporal marking an node to *t* |
| `toString()` | Returns a string of the node with all its parameters |

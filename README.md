# Directed & Weighted Graphs - EX2_OOP

## Presentation üìå

This project is based on ***Design and Implementation*** of directed and weighted graphs for an OOP assigment. This exercise is composed of two main parts, the first is to
implement the five different interfaces in order to create all the elements that form a graph. The second part is the GUI, which will allow us to really visualize 
the graph and all its parameters and options. 

<br />

## External Sources üîé

- Explanation about the *Dijkstra Algorithm* on this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB4MIexjvY0&list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O&index=45) video, detailling
 all the process in examples with the drawbacks and analysing the time complexity.
 
 - Inofrmation about the famous problem of [Travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).This optimization problem which consists in determining, given a list of cities and the distances between all the pairs of cities, the shortest circuit that passes through every town once and only once.

- Tutorial on the [*BFS Algorithm*](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-bfs).This algorithm is used to calculate the distances of all the nodes from a source node in an  graph directed or not directed.

## Interfaces üéØ

There are 5 classes defined in this project, the interfaces are in the ```api``` package and their implementations can be found in ```classes``` package. Their properties and 
methods are detailed below.

### <ins>***1 - NodeData***<ins> 


NodeDataObj is an implementation of a NodeData interface. This class is a simple representation of a vertex on a directed weighted graph and implement a set of different
operations.

Each ```NodeDataObj``` contains five attributes:

  - ```key```: This is the ID associated to each node.
  - ```location```: This is the position of the node in a 3D dimension with 3 coordinates(x,y,z).
  - ```weight```: This is a double variable used as node's weight initialized to 0. 
  - ```tag```: This is an Integer value used to calculate several algorithms initialized to 0.
  - ```info```: This is a string corresponding to node‚Äôs meta data which helps us to calculate various functions initialized to "White".

### <ins>***2 - EdgeData***<ins>
  
  EdgeDataObj is a representation of a EdgeData interface. This class designes all the characteristics and operations applicable on a directional edge defined by its source and   destination in a directional weighted graph.

  An ```EdgeDataObj``` is discribed by five fields:
  
  - ```src```: This integer represents the source node of the edge.
  - ```dest```: This integer represents the destination node of the edge.
  - ```weight```: This is a double variable used as edge's weight, must be positive. 
  - ```info```: This is a string corresponding to edge‚Äôs meta data. 
  - ```tag```: This is an Integer temporal value used in many fonctions initialized to 0.

 Only three coordonates constitute a ```GeoLocationObj``` in a 3D space:
  
  - ```x```: the node‚Äôs value on the x axis.
  - ```y```: the node‚Äôs value on the y axis.

   ### <ins>***5 - DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms***<ins>
  
  Implemented by DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithmsObj, DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms is the most important class that does the most "hardest job". Indeed, it will use certain algorithms and import external libraries which will allow us to perform several actions on the DirectedWeightedGraphObj.
  
  `DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithmsObj` is characterized by only one object: a `DirectedWeightedGraphObj`.

  <br />

| **Main methods**      |    **Explanation**  |

  <br /> 
  
* <ins>***Algorithm and other Methods***<ins>:
  
  **1 . ```BFS_Algo(NodeData node)```:**
  
    The BFS function based on Breadth First Search Traversal means visiting all the nodes of a graph searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure. It helps us 
  to verify if the graph is connected by passing over all the neighbors of the source and then explore them one by one. The algorithm stores the visited nodes in a queue and 
  increment a counter by one for every node connected to the source.
  The algorithm works as follows:
    - Start by putting the source node in the queue.
    - Remove the node from the beginning of the queue to process it.
    - Iterate over all the neighbors edges of this node.
    - Put all its unvisited neighbors in the queue.
    - Set its tag to 1 and increment the counter.
    - Repeat the process until the queue is empty.
  
      If the counter is equal to the `nodeSize()`, that means that the source node is connected.
      The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is **O(V+E)** where V is thenumber of nodes and E the number of edges.
  
    <br />
  
  **2. ```ppEdge(JSONObject edge)```:** 
  
     This private method is used in order to load the edges graph from a **Json** file, importing Json librairies like `JSONArray`, `JSONObject`or `JSONParser`.    
  
    <br />
  
  **3. ```ppNode(JSONObject node)```:**
  
     As the same, this private method is used in order to load the nodes graph from a **Json** file.
  
  <br />
  
  **4. ```Dijkstra(NodeData src, NodeData dst)```:**
